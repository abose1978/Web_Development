            OVERVIEW
        </h1>
        <p>
            Instrumentation is the most happening field in the world now. Electronics and Instrumentation
            Engineering is essentially the application of electronics in the field of Instrumentation 
            Engineering. Since electronics being the order of the day, it is very much necessary for the 
            young minds to get accustomed with the latest developments in electronics field. 
            Instrumentation is defined as the art and science of measurement and control of process 
            parameters like temperature, pressure, flow−rate, humidity, density, viscosity, moistures, 
            velocity etc. through proper designing and configuring of automated systems in electrical, 
            pneumatic domains within a production or manufacturing area. To measure and control the 
            parameters in a process or in a particular system, devices such as Sensors, Transducers, 
            Transmitters, Microprocessors, Microcontrollers, Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC), 
            Distributed Control System (DCS), Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) are used.
        </p>
        <p>
            Instrumentation engineers work with the industries with the goal of improving productivity, 
            optimization, stability, reliability, safety and continuity. Over the past three decades the 
            field of instrumentation engineering is contributing in extremely widespread applications in 
            the industries like (1) Process Industries such as Steel Plants, Refineries, Power plant, 
            Chemical and Fertilizer Plants, Textile Industries, Petrochemical Industries, Food Processing
            Industries., (2) Mining & Metallurgy Industries, (3) Robotics and Bio−Medical Instrumentation,
            (4) Automobile Instrumentation industries, (5) Navigational & Aerospace Organization, Weather 
            Stations etc. (6) Building Management Instrumentation, (7) Automation Engineering Companies. 
            Therefore, instrumentation being one of the most important sought after branches from the 
            industrial point of view, a combination of electronics and instrumentation would fetch high 
            dividends for the students who take up Electronics and Instrumentation as their career course.

        <h1 style="margin-left: 200px;">VISION</h1>
        <p>
            To aspire to be a premiere department; imparting world class technical education and to 
            bridge industry expertise with academic excellence, thereby producing technically competent 
            engineers catering to the needs of the society, environment and the nation.
        </p>
        <h1 style="margin-left: 200px;">MISSION</h1>
        <p>
            The mission of the Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering Department is to provide with
            a foundation in Electronics and Instrumentation, and the underlying mathematics and science,
            and to provide excellent opportunity with strong moral sense of social and ethical responsibilities,
            in order to build up professionally competent engineers through value−added teaching, learning and 
            research environment. The key objective is to provide state of the art infrastructure and a facilitating
            environment toward quality education and promote high standards of professional ethics, transparency
            and accountability. Department fosters establishing value creating networks with alumni, industries,
            educational institutes and other stakeholders and encourages collaborative research and consultancies
            with industries.
